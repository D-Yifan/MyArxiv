To this end, researchers have proposed several techniques\nto explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use these\nexplainability techniques because they often do not know which one to choose\nand how to interpret the results of the explanations. In this work, we address\nthese challenges by introducing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system for\nexplaining machine learning models through conversations. Specifically,\nTalkToModel comprises of three key components: 1) a natural language interface\nfor engaging in conversations, making ML model explainability highly\naccessible, 2) a dialogue engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset,\ninterprets natural language, maps it to appropriate explanations, and generates\ntext responses, and 3) an execution component that constructs the explanations.\nWe carried out extensive quantitative and human subject evaluations of\nTalkToModel. Overall, we found the conversational system understands user\ninputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the\nsystem's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations\nwith humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they\nwould use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability\nin a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel\nwas easier to use for computing explanations.

Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the\ninput, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it\ncomes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\\&L pretrained\nmodels, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its\npronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding\nthat utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP\ntext encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based\nembedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation\nencoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative\nevaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space\nrepresents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed\nphoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm\nthat the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text\nencoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more\nphonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies\nthe correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception\nregarding pronunciation similarity.\n","authors":["Chihaya Matsuhira","Marc A.

It is difficult to diagnose and\ncontinues to be underdiagnosed. Because depressed patients constantly share\ntheir symptoms, major life events, and treatments on social media, researchers\nare turning to user-generated digital traces on social media for depression\ndetection. Such methods have distinct advantages in combating depression\nbecause they can facilitate innovative approaches to fight depression and\nalleviate its social and economic burden. However, most existing studies lack\neffective means to incorporate established medical domain knowledge in\ndepression detection or suffer from feature extraction difficulties that impede\ngreater performance. Following the design science research paradigm, we propose\na Deep Knowledge-aware Depression Detection (DKDD) framework to accurately\ndetect social media users at risk of depression and explain the critical\nfactors that contribute to such detection. Extensive empirical studies with\nreal-world data demonstrate that, by incorporating domain knowledge, our method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work has significant\nimplications for IS research in knowledge-aware machine learning, digital\ntraces utilization, and NLP research in IS.

One line of work generalizes the notion of\nprotected subgroups beyond simple discrete classes by introducing the notion of\na \"rich subgroup\", and seeks to train models that are calibrated or equalize\nerror rates with respect to these richer subgroup classes. Largely\northogonally, local model explanation methods have been developed that given a\nclassifier h and test point x, attribute influence for the prediction h(x) to\nthe individual features of x. This raises a natural question: Do local model\nexplanation methods attribute different feature importance values on average\nacross different protected subgroups, and can we detect these disparities\nefficiently? If the model places high weight on a given feature in a specific\nprotected subgroup, but not on the dataset overall (or vice versa), this could\nbe a potential indicator of bias in the predictive model or the underlying data\ngenerating process, and is at the very least a useful diagnostic that signals\nthe need for a domain expert to delve deeper.

To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose\na semi-supervised sequential variational Bayes (DSVB) framework for transfer\nlearning and state inference in soft robots with missing state labels on\ncertain robot configurations. Considering that soft robots may exhibit distinct\ndynamics under different robot configurations, a feature space transfer\nstrategy is also incorporated to promote the adaptation of latent features\nacross multiple configurations.

To operate in such environments,\nrobots must have robust obstacle avoidance and versatile goal conditioning\nacquired from only a few simple demonstrations. Existing approaches, however,\nfall short of these requirements. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) enables a\nrobot to learn complex manipulation tasks but is often limited to small task\nspaces in the real world due to sample inefficiency and safety concerns. Motion\nplanning (MP) can generate collision-free paths in obstructed environments, but\ncannot solve complex manipulation tasks and requires goal states often\nspecified by a user or object-specific pose estimator. In this work, we propose\na system for efficient skill acquisition that leverages an object-centric\ngenerative model (OCGM) for versatile goal identification to specify a goal for\nMP combined with RL to solve complex manipulation tasks in obstructed\nenvironments. Specifically, OCGM enables one-shot target object identification\nand re-identification in new scenes, allowing MP to guide the robot to the\ntarget object while avoiding obstacles. This is combined with a skill\ntransition network, which bridges the gap between terminal states of MP and\nfeasible start states of a sample-efficient RL policy. The experiments\ndemonstrate that our OCGM-based one-shot goal identification provides\ncompetitive accuracy to other baseline approaches and that our modular\nframework outperforms competitive baselines, including a state-of-the-art RL\nalgorithm, by a significant margin for complex manipulation tasks in obstructed\nenvironments.\n","authors":["Jun Yamada","Jack Collins","Ingmar Posner"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03365v1.pdf","comment":"8 pages, 5 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03364v1","updated":"2023-03-06T18:49:39Z","published":"2023-03-06T18:49:39Z","title":"Leveraging Scene Embeddings for Gradient-Based Motion Planning in Latent\n  Space","summary":"  Motion planning framed as optimisation in structured latent spaces has\nrecently emerged as competitive with traditional methods in terms of planning\nsuccess while significantly outperforming them in terms of computational speed.\nHowever, the real-world applicability of recent work in this domain remains\nlimited by the need to express obstacle information directly in state-space,\ninvolving simple geometric primitives.

Symbolic systems commonly achieve data efficient generalization by\nexploiting modularity to benefit from local and discrete features of a\nrepresentation. These features allow symbolic programs to be improved one\nmodule at a time and to experience combinatorial growth in the values they can\nsuccessfully process. However, it is difficult to design components that can be\nused to form symbolic abstractions and which are highly-overparametrized like\nneural networks, as the adjustment of parameters makes the semantics of modules\nunstable.

In this work, we address\nthese challenges by introducing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system for\nexplaining machine learning models through conversations. Specifically,\nTalkToModel comprises of three key components: 1) a natural language interface\nfor engaging in conversations, making ML model explainability highly\naccessible, 2) a dialogue engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset,\ninterprets natural language, maps it to appropriate explanations, and generates\ntext responses, and 3) an execution component that constructs the explanations.\nWe carried out extensive quantitative and human subject evaluations of\nTalkToModel. Overall, we found the conversational system understands user\ninputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the\nsystem's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations\nwith humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they\nwould use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability\nin a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel\nwas easier to use for computing explanations.

On the one hand, ID loss learns invariant signals by directly\nminimizing the mean square error between the target samples and positive\nsamples in the representation space. On the other hand, ID loss ensures that\nthe representations are discriminative by an orthonormal constraint forcing the\ndifferent dimensions of representations to be independent of each other.

We exploit classical spatial\ntransformations (i.e. rotation and translation) with the specific parameter as\ntrigger patterns to design a simple yet effective poisoning-based backdoor\nattack. For example, only images rotated to a particular angle can activate the\nembedded backdoor of attacked DNNs.

However, this analysis ignores the dependence of adversarial\nattacks on model parameters. Since adversarial attacks are optimized for\nmodels, they should depend on the parameters. Considering this dependence, we\nanalyze the smoothness of the loss function of adversarial training using the\noptimal attacks for the model parameter in more detail. We reveal that the\nconstraint of adversarial attacks is one cause of the non-smoothness and that\nthe smoothness depends on the types of the constraints. Specifically, the\n$L_\\infty$ constraint can cause non-smoothness more than the $L_2$ constraint.\nMoreover, our analysis implies that if we flatten the loss function with\nrespect to input data, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of adversarial\nloss tends to increase.

Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the\ninput, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it\ncomes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\\&L pretrained\nmodels, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its\npronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding\nthat utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP\ntext encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based\nembedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation\nencoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative\nevaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space\nrepresents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed\nphoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm\nthat the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text\nencoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more\nphonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies\nthe correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception\nregarding pronunciation similarity.\n","authors":["Chihaya Matsuhira","Marc A.

However, NSI and\nORSI are different in many aspects, such as large coverage, complex background,\nand large differences in target types and scales. Therefore, a new dedicated\nmethod is needed for ORSI-SOD. In addition, existing methods do not pay\nsufficient attention to the boundary of the object, and the completeness of the\nfinal saliency map still needs improvement. To address these issues, we propose\na novel method called Dual Feedback Attention Framework via Boundary-Aware\nAuxiliary and Progressive Semantic Optimization (DFA-BASO). First, Boundary\nProtection Calibration (BPC) module is proposed to reduce the loss of edge\nposition information during forward propagation and suppress noise in low-level\nfeatures. Second, a Dual Feature Feedback Complementary (DFFC) module is\nproposed based on BPC module. It aggregates boundary-semantic dual features and\nprovides effective feedback to coordinate features across different layers.\nFinally, a Strong Semantic Feedback Refinement (SSFR) module is proposed to\nobtain more complete saliency maps. This module further refines feature\nrepresentation and eliminates feature differences through a unique feedback\nmechanism. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that DFA-BASO\noutperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, this paper strongly\ndemonstrates the true contribution of DFA-BASO to ORSI-SOD by in-depth analysis\nof the visualization figure.

One\ncomplication in this learning task is that some users are more likely to\npurchase products or review them, and some products are more likely to be\npurchased or reviewed by the users. This non-uniform pattern degrades the power\nof many existing recommendation algorithms, as they assume that the observed\ndata are sampled uniformly at random among user-product pairs. In addition,\nexisting literature on modeling non-uniformity either assume user interests are\nindependent of the products, or lack theoretical understanding. In this paper,\nwe first model the user-product preferences as a partially observed matrix with\nnon-uniform observation pattern. Next, building on the literature about\nlow-rank matrix estimation, we introduce a new weighted trace-norm penalized\nregression to predict unobserved values of the matrix. We then prove an upper\nbound for the prediction error of our proposed approach. Our upper bound is a\nfunction of a number of parameters that are based on a certain weight matrix\nthat depends on the joint distribution of users and products. Utilizing this\nobservation, we introduce a new optimization problem to select a weight matrix\nthat minimizes the upper bound on the prediction error. The final product is a\nnew estimator, NU-Recommend, that outperforms existing methods in both\nsynthetic and real datasets. Our approach aims at accurate predictions for all\nusers while prioritizing fairness.

There are many methodological decisions that\nneed to be considered in order to obtain scientifically valid results, and each\nof these decisions incur costs.

The problem generalizes the well-studied\nrisk-neutral finite-sum distributed optimization problem and its importance\nstems from the need to handle risk in an uncertain environment. For algorithms\nin the literature, there exists a gap in communication complexities for solving\nrisk-averse and risk-neutral problems. We propose two distributed algorithms,\nnamely the distributed risk averse optimization (DRAO) method and the\ndistributed risk averse optimization with sliding (DRAO-S) method, to close the\ngap. Specifically, the DRAO method achieves the optimal communication\ncomplexity by assuming a certain saddle point subproblem can be easily solved\nin the server node. The DRAO-S method removes the strong assumption by\nintroducing a novel saddle point sliding subroutine which only requires the\nprojection over the ambiguity set $P$.

A natural question to ask is: How much more sample efficiency can\nbe gained by improving the learned dynamics models? Our paper empirically\nanswers this question for the class of model-based value expansion methods in\ncontinuous control problems. Value expansion methods should benefit from\nincreased model accuracy by enabling longer rollout horizons and better value\nfunction approximations. Our empirical study, which leverages oracle dynamics\nmodels to avoid compounding model errors, shows that (1) longer horizons\nincrease sample efficiency, but the gain in improvement decreases with each\nadditional expansion step, and (2) the increased model accuracy only marginally\nincreases the sample efficiency compared to learned models with identical\nhorizons. Therefore, longer horizons and increased model accuracy yield\ndiminishing returns in terms of sample efficiency. These improvements in sample\nefficiency are particularly disappointing when compared to model-free value\nexpansion methods. Even though they introduce no computational overhead, we\nfind their performance to be on-par with model-based value expansion methods.\nTherefore, we conclude that the limitation of model-based value expansion\nmethods is not the model accuracy of the learned models.

Although only the model parameters or\nother model updates are exchanged during the federated training instead of the\nparticipant's data, many attacks have shown that it is still possible to infer\nsensitive information such as membership, property, or outright reconstruction\nof participant data. Although differential privacy is considered an effective\nsolution to protect against privacy attacks, it is also criticized for its\nnegative effect on utility. Another possible defense is to use secure\naggregation which allows the server to only access the aggregated update\ninstead of each individual one, and it is often more appealing because it does\nnot degrade model quality. However, combining only the aggregated updates,\nwhich are generated by a different composition of clients in every round, may\nstill allow the inference of some client-specific information.\n  In this paper, we show that simple linear models can effectively capture\nclient-specific properties only from the aggregated model updates due to the\nlinearity of aggregation. We formulate an optimization problem across different\nrounds in order to infer a tested property of every client from the output of\nthe linear models, for example, whether they have a specific sample in their\ntraining data (membership inference) or whether they misbehave and attempt to\ndegrade the performance of the common model by poisoning attacks. Our\nreconstruction technique is completely passive and undetectable. We demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our approach on several scenarios which shows that secure\naggregation provides very limited privacy guarantees in practice.

By incorporating input distributions and prior knowledge, the FIFK\noperator can address the limitations of using high-dimensional input\ndistributions by semi-supervised assumptions, leading to more precise\napproximations of the integral operator.

This is\nsufficient in the case of sample refinement, where the source and target\ndistributions of the flow are close to each other.

With the growing availability of side\ninformation involved in the decision process, modern online matching\nmethodology demands the capability to track preference dynamics for agents\nbased on their contextual information. This motivates us to consider a novel\nContextual Online Matching Bandit prOblem (COMBO), which allows dynamic\npreferences in matching decisions.

Current state-of-the-art deep\nlearning (DL)-based damage detection models, however, often lack superior\nfeature extraction capability in complex and noisy environments, limiting the\ndevelopment of accurate and reliable object distinction.

Existing studies have\nconsidered exclusively noise with persistent root-mean-square amplitude and\noverlooked an opportunity of adjusting the amplitudes to alleviate the adverse\neffects of the noise. This paper presents a new DP perturbation mechanism with\na time-varying noise amplitude to protect the privacy of FL and retain the\ncapability of adjusting the learning performance. Specifically, we propose a\ngeometric series form for the noise amplitude and reveal analytically the\ndependence of the series on the number of global aggregations and the\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP requirement. We derive an online refinement of the\nseries to prevent FL from premature convergence resulting from excessive\nperturbation noise. Another important aspect is an upper bound developed for\nthe loss function of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained by FL running the\nnew DP mechanism. Accordingly, the optimal number of global aggregations is\nobtained, balancing the learning and privacy. Extensive experiments are\nconducted using MLP, supporting vector machine, and convolutional neural\nnetwork models on four public datasets.

There is an accelerating trend of representing a reversible\nsteo-system by monolithic neural networks, which bypass intermediate operations\nin traditional pipelines of reversible steganography. This end-to-end paradigm,\nhowever, suffers from imperfect reversibility. By contrast, the modular\nparadigm that incorporates neural networks into modules of traditional\npipelines can stably guarantee reversibility with mathematical explainability.\nPrediction-error modulation is a well-established reversible steganography\npipeline for digital images. It consists of a predictive analytics module and a\nreversible coding module. Given that reversibility is governed independently by\nthe coding module, we narrow our focus to the incorporation of neural networks\ninto the analytics module, which serves the purpose of predicting pixel\nintensities and a pivotal role in determining capacity and imperceptibility.\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the impacts of different training\nconfigurations upon predictive accuracy of neural networks and provide\npractical insights.

A fundamental pillar of reversible steganography is\npredictive modelling which can be realised via deep neural networks.

In view of this issue, we propose to consider uncertainty in predictive\nmodels based upon a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning, thereby\ncreating an adaptive steganographic system. Most modern deep-learning models\nare regarded as deterministic because they only offer predictions while failing\nto provide uncertainty measurement. Bayesian neural networks bring a\nprobabilistic perspective to deep learning and can be regarded as self-aware\nintelligent machinery; that is, a machine that knows its own limitations. To\nquantify uncertainty, we apply Bayesian statistics to model the predictive\ndistribution and approximate it through Monte Carlo sampling with stochastic\nforward passes.

It\nalso iteratively revises LLM prompts to improve model responses using feedback\ngenerated by utility functions, e.g., the factuality score of a LLM-generated\nresponse. The effectiveness of LLM-Augmenter is empirically validated on two\ntypes of scenarios, task-oriented dialog and open-domain question answering.\nLLM-Augmenter significantly reduces ChatGPT's hallucinations without\nsacrificing the fluency and informativeness of its responses.

Therefore, the quality of the given corpora and their\nentity annotation has become the bottleneck that limits the performance of such\nmethods. To overcome this dilemma and make the ESE models free from the\ndependence on entity annotation, our work aims to explore a new ESE paradigm,\nnamely corpus-independent ESE. Specifically, we devise a context pattern\ngeneration module that utilizes autoregressive language models (e.g., GPT-2) to\nautomatically generate high-quality context patterns for entities.

The method to achieve feature alignments is called\n``compatible learning''. Existing research mainly focuses on the one-to-one\ncompatible paradigm, which is limited in learning compatibility among multiple\nmodels. We propose a Switchable representation learning Framework with\nSelf-Compatibility (SFSC). SFSC generates a series of compatible sub-models\nwith different capacities through one training process. The optimization of\nsub-models faces gradients conflict, and we mitigate this problem from the\nperspective of the magnitude and direction. We adjust the priorities of\nsub-models dynamically through uncertainty estimation to co-optimize sub-models\nproperly. Besides, the gradients with conflicting directions are projected to\navoid mutual interference. SFSC achieves state-of-the-art performance on the\nevaluated datasets.\n","authors":["Shengsen Wu","Yan Bai","Yihang Lou","Xiongkun Linghu","Jianzhong He","Ling-Yu Duan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.08289v3.pdf","comment":"Accepted by CVPR 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04391v1","updated":"2023-03-08T05:52:58Z","published":"2023-03-08T05:52:58Z","title":"A Deep-Learning-Based Neural Decoding Framework for Emotional\n  Brain-Computer Interfaces","summary":"  Reading emotions precisely from segments of neural activity is crucial for\nthe development of emotional brain-computer interfaces.

In object-oriented environments, predicates are a particularly useful\nform of state abstraction because of their compatibility with symbolic planners\nand their capacity for relational generalization. However, to plan with\npredicates, the agent must be able to interpret them in continuous environment\nstates (i.e., ground the symbols). Manually programming predicate\ninterpretations can be difficult, so we would instead like to learn them from\ndata. We propose an embodied active learning paradigm where the agent learns\npredicate interpretations through online interaction with an expert. For\nexample, after taking actions in a block stacking environment, the agent may\nask the expert: \"Is On(block1, block2) true?\" From this experience, the agent\nlearns to plan: it learns neural predicate interpretations, symbolic planning\noperators, and neural samplers that can be used for bilevel planning. During\nexploration, the agent plans to learn: it uses its current models to select\nactions towards generating informative expert queries. We learn predicate\ninterpretations as ensembles of neural networks and use their entropy to\nmeasure the informativeness of potential queries. We evaluate this approach in\nthree robotic environments and find that it consistently outperforms six\nbaselines while exhibiting sample efficiency in two key metrics: number of\nenvironment interactions, and number of queries to the expert.

This paper introduces a new method\nto automate formal verification: We use large language models, trained on\nnatural language text and code and fine-tuned on proofs, to generate whole\nproofs for theorems at once, rather than one step at a time. We combine this\nproof generation model with a fine-tuned repair model to repair generated\nproofs, further increasing proving power.

To alleviate the quality degradation, it\ncomes the rise of Neural-enhanced Video Streaming (NVS), which shows great\nprospects for recovering low-quality videos by mostly deploying neural\nsuper-resolution (SR) on the media server. Despite its benefit, we reveal that\ncurrent mainstream works with SR enhancement have not achieved the desired\nrate-distortion trade-off between bitrate saving and quality restoration, due\nto: (1) overemphasizing the enhancement on the decoder side while omitting the\nco-design of encoder, (2) limited generative capacity to recover high-fidelity\nperceptual details, and (3) optimizing the compression-and-restoration pipeline\nfrom the resolution perspective solely, without considering color bit-depth.\nAiming at overcoming these limitations, we are the first to conduct an\nencoder-decoder (i.e., codec) synergy by leveraging the inherent\nvisual-generative property of diffusion models. Specifically, we present the\nCodec-aware Diffusion Modeling (CaDM), a novel NVS paradigm to significantly\nreduce streaming delivery bitrates while holding pretty higher restoration\ncapacity over existing methods. First, CaDM improves the encoder's compression\nefficiency by simultaneously reducing resolution and color bit-depth of video\nframes. Second, CaDM empowers the decoder with high-quality enhancement by\nmaking the denoising diffusion restoration aware of encoder's resolution-color\nconditions. Evaluation on public cloud services with OpenMMLab benchmarks shows\nthat CaDM effectively saves up to 5.12 - 21.44 times bitrates based on common\nvideo standards and achieves much better recovery quality (e.g., FID of 0.61)\nover state-of-the-art neural-enhancing methods.\n","authors":["Qihua Zhou","Ruibin Li","Song Guo","Peiran Dong","Yi Liu","Jingcai Guo","Zhenda Xu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.08428v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03131v2","updated":"2023-03-08T11:35:51Z","published":"2023-03-06T13:49:15Z","title":"Video Question Answering Using CLIP-Guided Visual-Text Attention","summary":"  Cross-modal learning of video and text plays a key role in Video Question\nAnswering (VideoQA).

The main reason is that\nconventional Transformer decoding algorithms may not be the best choice for\ncode generation. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer decoding\nalgorithm, Planning-Guided Transformer Decoding (PG-TD), that uses a planning\nalgorithm to do lookahead search and guide the Transformer to generate better\nprograms. Specifically, instead of simply optimizing the likelihood of the\ngenerated sequences, the Transformer makes use of a planner to generate\ncandidate programs and test them on public test cases. The Transformer can\ntherefore make more informed decisions and generate tokens that will eventually\nlead to higher-quality programs. We also design a mechanism that shares\ninformation between the Transformer and the planner to make our algorithm\ncomputationally efficient. We empirically evaluate our framework with several\nlarge language models as backbones on public coding challenge benchmarks,\nshowing that 1) it can generate programs that consistently achieve higher\nperformance compared with competing baseline methods; 2) it enables\ncontrollable code generation, such as concise codes and highly-commented codes\nby optimizing modified objective.\n","authors":["Shun Zhang","Zhenfang Chen","Yikang Shen","Mingyu Ding","Joshua B.

Prior work has shown\nthat pretrained LMs can be taught to caption images when a vision model's\nparameters are optimized to encode images in the language space. We test a\nstronger hypothesis: that the conceptual representations learned by frozen\ntext-only models and vision-only models are similar enough that this can be\nachieved with a linear map. We show that the image representations from vision\nmodels can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only\na single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive\nperformance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to\nmodels that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA\nmodel). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions). We find that all three encoders perform equally well at\ntransferring visual property information to the language model (e.g., whether\nan animal is large or small), but that image encoders pretrained with\nlinguistic supervision more saliently encode category information (e.g.,\ndistinguishing hippo vs. elephant) and thus perform significantly better on\nbenchmark language-and-vision tasks.

These adversarial examples are imperceptible to human\nreaders but can mislead models to make the wrong predictions. In a black-box\nsetting, attacker can fool the model without knowing model's parameters and\narchitecture. Previous works on word-level attacks widely use single semantic\nspace and greedy search as a search strategy. However, these methods fail to\nbalance the attack success rate, quality of adversarial examples and time\nconsumption. In this paper, we propose BeamAttack, a textual attack algorithm\nthat makes use of mixed semantic spaces and improved beam search to craft\nhigh-quality adversarial examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nBeamAttack can improve attack success rate while saving numerous queries and\ntime, e.g., improving at most 7\\% attack success rate than greedy search when\nattacking the examples from MR dataset. Compared with heuristic search,\nBeamAttack can save at most 85\\% model queries and achieve a competitive attack\nsuccess rate.

However, in many settings, giving\none type of feedback (e.g. a demonstration) may be much more difficult than a\ndifferent type of feedback (e.g. answering a comparison query). Thus, we expect\nto see more or less noise depending on the type of human feedback. In this\nwork, we advocate that grounding the rationality coefficient in real data for\neach feedback type, rather than assuming a default value, has a significant\npositive effect on reward learning. We test this in both simulated experiments\nand in a user study with real human feedback. We find that overestimating human\nrationality can have dire effects on reward learning accuracy and regret. We\nalso find that fitting the rationality coefficient to human data enables better\nreward learning, even when the human deviates significantly from the\nnoisy-rational choice model due to systematic biases. Further, we find that the\nrationality level affects the informativeness of each feedback type:\nsurprisingly, demonstrations are not always the most informative -- when the\nhuman acts very suboptimally, comparisons actually become more informative,\neven when the rationality level is the same for both.

To address these challenges, we introduce Goal\nSampling Adaptation for Scooping (GOATS), a curriculum reinforcement learning\nmethod that can learn an effective and generalizable policy for robot scooping\ntasks.

In many\ncases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a\ngiven, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and\nbattery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as\nefficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by\nabstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that\nemulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this\nframework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search\narea) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual\ncues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to\nobserve the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus\nit has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the\ngoal. To tackle this task, we propose AiRLoc, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based model that decouples exploration (searching for distant goals) and\nexploitation (localizing nearby goals). Extensive evaluations show that AiRLoc\noutperforms heuristic search methods as well as alternative learnable\napproaches, and that it generalizes across datasets, e.g. to disaster-hit areas\nwithout seeing a single disaster scenario during training.

However, there is still a need to bridge the gap between what\nRNNs are capable of in terms of efficiency and performance and real-world\napplication requirements. The memory and computational requirements arising\nfrom propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every\nconnected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations,\ncontribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a\nsolution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication\nbetween RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as\nwell.

We compare HBNODE with\nother popular ROMs on several complex dynamical systems, including the von\nK\\'{a}rm\\'{a}n Street flow, the Kurganov-Petrova-Popov equation, and the\none-dimensional Euler equations for fluids modeling.\n","authors":["Justin Baker","Elena Cherkaev","Akil Narayan","Bao Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12373v2.pdf","comment":"31 pages, 20 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02204v2","updated":"2023-03-09T20:04:05Z","published":"2023-03-03T20:31:04Z","title":"Linked Data Science Powered by Knowledge Graphs","summary":"  In recent years, we have witnessed a growing interest in data science not\nonly from academia but particularly from companies investing in data science\nplatforms to analyze large amounts of data. In this process, a myriad of data\nscience artifacts, such as datasets and pipeline scripts, are created. Yet,\nthere has so far been no systematic attempt to holistically exploit the\ncollected knowledge and experiences that are implicitly contained in the\nspecification of these pipelines, e.g., compatible datasets, cleansing steps,\nML algorithms, parameters, etc. Instead, data scientists still spend a\nconsiderable amount of their time trying to recover relevant information and\nexperiences from colleagues, trial and error, lengthy exploration, etc. In this\npaper, we, therefore, propose a scalable system (KGLiDS) that employs machine\nlearning to extract the semantics of data science pipelines and captures them\nin a knowledge graph, which can then be exploited to assist data scientists in\nvarious ways. This abstraction is the key to enabling Linked Data Science since\nit allows us to share the essence of pipelines between platforms, companies,\nand institutions without revealing critical internal information and instead\nfocusing on the semantics of what is being processed and how.

To address these limitations, this paper\npresents an adaptive, activation-based, structured pruning approach to\nautomatically and efficiently generate small, accurate, and hardware-efficient\nmodels that meet user requirements. First, it proposes iterative structured\npruning using activation-based attention feature maps to effectively identify\nand prune unimportant filters.

Although preserving legibility is a necessary\ncondition for text perturbation, little work has been done to systematically\ncharacterize it; instead, legibility is typically loosely enforced via\nintuitions around the nature and extent of perturbations. Particularly, it is\nunclear to what extent can inputs be perturbed while preserving legibility, or\nhow to quantify the legibility of a perturbed string. In this work, we address\nthis gap by learning models that predict the legibility of a perturbed string,\nand rank candidate perturbations based on their legibility. To do so, we\ncollect and release LEGIT, a human-annotated dataset comprising the legibility\nof visually perturbed text. Using this dataset, we build both text- and\nvision-based models which achieve up to $0.91$ F1 score in predicting whether\nan input is legible, and an accuracy of $0.86$ in predicting which of two given\nperturbations is more legible. Additionally, we discover that legible\nperturbations from the LEGIT dataset are more effective at lowering the\nperformance of NLP models than best-known attack strategies, suggesting that\ncurrent models may be vulnerable to a broad range of perturbations beyond what\nis captured by existing visual attacks.

As sports betting is a multi-billion dollar industry\nin the USA alone, identifying such opportunities could be extremely lucrative.\nMany researchers have applied machine learning to the sports outcome prediction\nproblem, generally using accuracy to evaluate the performance of forecasting\nmodels. We hypothesise that for the sports betting problem, model calibration\nis more important than accuracy. To test this hypothesis, we train models on\nNBA data over several seasons and run betting experiments on a single season,\nusing published odds. Evaluating various betting systems, we show that\noptimising the forecasting model for calibration leads to greater returns than\noptimising for accuracy, on average (return on investment of $110.42\\%$ versus\n$2.98\\%$) and in the best case ($902.01\\%$ versus $222.84\\%$). These findings\nsuggest that for sports betting (or any forecasting problem where decisions are\nmade based on the predicted probability of each outcome), calibration is a more\nimportant metric than accuracy.

There are many proposed methods\nfor forecasting solar irradiance / solar power production.

This\nrequires both access to a real-time stream of data and enough historical\nobservations for these methods to be deployed.

In this paper, motivated by certain operational concerns in\nonline platforms, we consider a new objective in the classical setup. Given $K$\narms, instead of maximizing the expected total reward from $T$ pulls (the\ntraditional \"sum\" objective), we consider the vector of total rewards earned\nfrom each of the $K$ arms at the end of $T$ pulls and aim to maximize the\nexpected highest total reward across arms (the \"max\" objective).

We then design an adaptive explore-then-commit policy\nfeaturing exploration based on appropriately tuned confidence bounds on the\nmean reward and an adaptive stopping criterion, which adapts to the problem\ndifficulty and achieves these bounds (up to logarithmic factors).

This paper studies two key problems with regard to traffic\nvolume estimation: (1) underdetermined traffic flows caused by undetected\nmovements, and (2) non-equilibrium traffic flows arise from congestion\npropagation. Here we demonstrate a graph-based deep learning method that can\noffer a data-driven, model-free and correlation adaptive approach to tackle the\nabove issues and perform accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation.\nParticularly, in order to quantify the dynamic and nonlinear relationships\nbetween traffic speed and volume for the estimation of underdetermined flows, a\nspeed patternadaptive adjacent matrix based on graph attention is developed and\nintegrated into the graph convolution process, to capture non-local\ncorrelations between sensors.

We consider a set\n$V=\\{v_1,\\ldots,v_n\\}$ of nodes, and generate a random DAG $G=(V,E)$ where\n$(v_a, v_b) \\in E$ with i.i.d. probability $p_1$ if $a<b$ and $0$ if $a > b$.\nWe provide upper bounds on the probability that a subset of $V-\\{x,y\\}$\nd-separates $x$ and $y$, conditional on $x$ and $y$ being d-separable; our\nupper bounds decay exponentially fast to $0$ as $|V| \\rightarrow \\infty$. For\nthe PC Algorithm, while it is known that its worst-case guarantees fail on\nnon-sparse graphs, we show that the same is true for the average case, and that\nthe sparsity requirement is quite demanding: for good performance, the density\nmust go to $0$ as $|V| \\rightarrow \\infty$ even in the average case. For\nUniformSGS, while it is known that the running time is exponential for existing\nedges, we show that in the average case, that is the expected running time for\nmost non-existing edges as well.\n","authors":["Itai Feigenbaum","Huan Wang","Shelby Heinecke","Juan Carlos Niebles","Weiran Yao","Caiming Xiong","Devansh Arpit"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05628v1.pdf","comment":null}],"Multi Media":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14402v2","updated":"2023-03-10T07:56:58Z","published":"2023-02-28T08:35:50Z","title":"Neural Video Compression with Diverse Contexts","summary":"  For any video codecs, the coding efficiency highly relies on whether the\ncurrent signal to be encoded can find the relevant contexts from the previous\nreconstructed signals. Traditional codec has verified more contexts bring\nsubstantial coding gain, but in a time-consuming manner. However, for the\nemerging neural video codec (NVC), its contexts are still limited, leading to\nlow compression ratio. To boost NVC, this paper proposes increasing the context\ndiversity in both temporal and spatial dimensions. First, we guide the model to\nlearn hierarchical quality patterns across frames, which enriches long-term and\nyet high-quality temporal contexts. Furthermore, to tap the potential of\noptical flow-based coding framework, we introduce a group-based offset\ndiversity where the cross-group interaction is proposed for better context\nmining. In addition, this paper also adopts a quadtree-based partition to\nincrease spatial context diversity when encoding the latent representation in\nparallel.

Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to\ncontinually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred. In this work, we revisit CIL with\nPTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model updating\nand generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal that frozen\nPTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL. Surprisingly, a\nsimple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the classifiers of PTM to\nprototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without training on the\ndownstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between pre-trained and\ndownstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with adaptivity via model\nadapting. We propose ADapt And Merge (ADAM), which aggregates the embeddings of\nPTM and adapted models for classifier construction. ADAM is a general framework\nthat can be orthogonally combined with any parameter-efficient tuning method,\nwhich holds the advantages of PTM's generalizability and adapted model's\nadaptivity. 3) Additionally, we find previous benchmarks are unsuitable in the\nera of PTM due to data overlapping and propose four new benchmarks for\nassessment, namely ImageNet-A, ObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

CNNs also lack invariance\nin the classification of symmetric samples because CNNs can classify symmetric\nsamples differently. Considered together, the CNN lack of adversarial\nrobustness and the CNN lack of invariance mean that the classification of\nsymmetric adversarial samples can differ from their incorrect classification.\nCould symmetric adversarial samples revert to their correct classification?\nThis paper answers this question by designing a symmetry defense that inverts\nor horizontally flips adversarial samples before classification against\nadversaries unaware of the defense. Against adversaries aware of the defense,\nthe defense devises a Klein four symmetry subgroup that includes the horizontal\nflip and pixel inversion symmetries. The symmetry defense uses the subgroup\nsymmetries in accuracy evaluation and the subgroup closure property to confine\nthe transformations that an adaptive adversary can apply before or after\ngenerating the adversarial sample.

In\nthis work, we present a unifying view of existing MI bounds from the\nperspective of importance sampling, and propose three novel bounds based on\nthis approach. Since accurate estimation of MI without density information\nrequires a sample size exponential in the true MI, we assume either a single\nmarginal or the full joint density information is known. In settings where the\nfull joint density is available, we propose Multi-Sample Annealed Importance\nSampling (AIS) bounds on MI, which we demonstrate can tightly estimate large\nvalues of MI in our experiments.

However, even the most accurate NNs can be biased\ntoward a specific output classification due to the inherent bias in the\navailable training datasets, which may propagate to the real-world\nimplementations. This paper deals with the robustness bias, i.e., the bias\nexhibited by the trained NN by having a significantly large robustness to noise\nfor a certain output class, as compared to the remaining output classes. The\nbias is shown to result from imbalanced datasets, i.e., the datasets where all\noutput classes are not equally represented. Towards this, we propose the\nUnbiasedNets framework, which leverages K-means clustering and the NN's noise\ntolerance to diversify the given training dataset, even from relatively smaller\ndatasets. This generates balanced datasets and reduces the bias within the\ndatasets themselves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework\ncatering to the robustness bias problem in NNs. We use real-world datasets to\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the UnbiasedNets for data diversification, in case\nof both binary and multi-label classifiers. The results are compared to\nwell-known tools aimed at generating balanced datasets, and illustrate how\nexisting works have limited success while addressing the robustness bias. In\ncontrast, UnbiasedNets provides a notable improvement over existing works,\nwhile even reducing the robustness bias significantly in some cases, as\nobserved by comparing the NNs trained on the diversified and original datasets.\n","authors":["Mahum Naseer","Bharath Srinivas Prabakaran","Osman Hasan","Muhammad Shafique"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12538v2.pdf","comment":"Springer Machine Learning 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06931v1","updated":"2023-03-13T08:55:10Z","published":"2023-03-13T08:55:10Z","title":"DeepVigor: Vulnerability Value Ranges and Factors for DNNs' Reliability\n  Assessment","summary":"  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their accelerators are being deployed ever\nmore frequently in safety-critical applications leading to increasing\nreliability concerns.

Many existing tools\nrely on uniform convergence (UC), a property that, when it holds, guarantees\nthat the test loss will be close to the training loss, uniformly over a class\nof candidate models. Nagarajan and Kolter (2019) show that in certain simple\nlinear and neural-network settings, any uniform convergence bound will be\nvacuous, leaving open the question of how to prove generalization in settings\nwhere UC fails. Our main contribution is proving novel generalization bounds in\ntwo such settings, one linear, and one non-linear. We study the linear\nclassification setting of Nagarajan and Kolter, and a quadratic ground truth\nfunction learned via a two-layer neural network in the non-linear regime. We\nprove a new type of margin bound showing that above a certain signal-to-noise\nthreshold, any near-max-margin classifier will achieve almost no test loss in\nthese two settings. Our results show that near-max-margin is important: while\nany model that achieves at least a $(1 - \\epsilon)$-fraction of the max-margin\ngeneralizes well, a classifier achieving half of the max-margin may fail\nterribly. Building on the impossibility results of Nagarajan and Kolter, under\nslightly stronger assumptions, we show that one-sided UC bounds and classical\nmargin bounds will fail on near-max-margin classifiers. Our analysis provides\ninsight on why memorization can coexist with generalization: we show that in\nthis challenging regime where generalization occurs but UC fails,\nnear-max-margin classifiers simultaneously contain some generalizable\ncomponents and some overfitting components that memorize the data. The presence\nof the overfitting components is enough to preclude UC, but the near-extremal\nmargin guarantees that sufficient generalizable components are present.\n","authors":["Margalit Glasgow","Colin Wei","Mary Wootters","Tengyu Ma"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07892v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05205v2","updated":"2023-03-13T08:06:17Z","published":"2023-03-09T12:19:20Z","title":"Real-time scheduling of renewable power systems through planning-based\n  reinforcement learning","summary":"  The growing renewable energy sources have posed significant challenges to\ntraditional power scheduling.

In\nthe proposed scheme, each agent independently minimizes the distribution\nmismatch to the corresponding component of a target visitation distribution.\nThe theoretical analysis shows that under certain conditions, each agent\nminimizing its individual distribution mismatch allows the convergence to the\njoint policy that generated the target distribution. Further, if the target\ndistribution is from a joint policy that optimizes a cooperative task, the\noptimal policy for a combination of this task reward and the distribution\nmatching reward is the same joint policy. This insight is used to formulate a\npractical algorithm (DM$^2$), in which each individual agent matches a target\ndistribution derived from concurrently sampled trajectories from a joint expert\npolicy. Experimental validation on the StarCraft domain shows that combining\n(1) a task reward, and (2) a distribution matching reward for expert\ndemonstrations for the same task, allows agents to outperform a naive\ndistributed baseline. Additional experiments probe the conditions under which\nexpert demonstrations need to be sampled to obtain the learning benefits.\n","authors":["Caroline Wang","Ishan Durugkar","Elad Liebman","Peter Stone"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00233v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06818v1","updated":"2023-03-13T02:25:59Z","published":"2023-03-13T02:25:59Z","title":"Backdoor Defense via Deconfounded Representation Learning","summary":"  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are recently shown to be vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks, where attackers embed hidden backdoors in the DNN model by injecting a\nfew poisoned examples into the training dataset. While extensive efforts have\nbeen made to detect and remove backdoors from backdoored DNNs, it is still not\nclear whether a backdoor-free clean model can be directly obtained from\npoisoned datasets. In this paper, we first construct a causal graph to model\nthe generation process of poisoned data and find that the backdoor attack acts\nas the confounder, which brings spurious associations between the input images\nand target labels, making the model predictions less reliable. Inspired by the\ncausal understanding, we propose the Causality-inspired Backdoor Defense (CBD),\nto learn deconfounded representations for reliable classification.\nSpecifically, a backdoored model is intentionally trained to capture the\nconfounding effects. The other clean model dedicates to capturing the desired\ncausal effects by minimizing the mutual information with the confounding\nrepresentations from the backdoored model and employing a sample-wise\nre-weighting scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets\nagainst 6 state-of-the-art attacks verify that our proposed defense method is\neffective in reducing backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in\npredicting benign samples. Further analysis shows that CBD can also resist\npotential adaptive attacks.

Existing studies on provider fairness usually focused on\ndesigning proportion fairness (PF) metrics that first consider systematic\nfairness. However, sociological researches show that to make the market more\nstable, max-min fairness (MMF) is a better metric. The main reason is that MMF\naims to improve the utility of the worst ones preferentially, guiding the\nsystem to support the providers in weak market positions. When applying MMF to\nrecommender systems, how to balance user preferences and provider fairness in\nan online recommendation scenario is still a challenging problem. In this\npaper, we proposed an online re-ranking model named Provider Max-min Fairness\nRe-ranking (P-MMF) to tackle the problem. Specifically, P-MMF formulates\nprovider fair recommendation as a resource allocation problem, where the\nexposure slots are considered the resources to be allocated to providers and\nthe max-min fairness is used as the regularizer during the process. We show\nthat the problem can be further represented as a regularized online optimizing\nproblem and solved efficiently in its dual space.

To evaluate our approach, we have\nconstructed ContextDP, the current largest dataset of fully-localized UI dark\npatterns that spans 175 mobile and 83 web UI screenshots containing 301 dark\npattern instances. The results of our evaluation illustrate that \\AidUI\nachieves an overall precision of 0.66, recall of 0.67, F1-score of 0.65 in\ndetecting dark pattern instances, reports few false positives, and is able to\nlocalize detected patterns with an IoU score of ~0.84. Furthermore, a\nsignificant subset of our studied dark patterns can be detected quite reliably\n(F1 score of over 0.82), and future research directions may allow for improved\ndetection of additional patterns.\n","authors":["SM Hasan Mansur","Sabiha Salma","Damilola Awofisayo","Kevin Moran"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06782v1.pdf","comment":"13 pages, Accepted at The 45th IEEE/ACM International Conference on\n  Software Engineering (ICSE 2023), Melbourne, Australia, May 14th-20th, 2023"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15829v4","updated":"2023-03-12T23:36:54Z","published":"2021-10-29T14:46:32Z","title":"Holistic Deep Learning","summary":"  This paper presents a novel holistic deep learning framework that\nsimultaneously addresses the challenges of vulnerability to input\nperturbations, overparametrization, and performance instability from different\ntrain-validation splits.

The effectiveness of our proposed method is evaluated on\nthe Human3.6M dataset. Our model also shows better generalization ability by\ntesting on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset.

Despite their promising performance, current text-to-sound\ngeneration models face issues on small-scale datasets (e.g., overfitting),\nsignificantly limiting their performance. In this paper, we investigate the use\nof pre-trained AudioLDM, the state-of-the-art model for text-to-audio\ngeneration, as the backbone for sound generation. Our study demonstrates the\nadvantages of using pre-trained models for text-to-sound generation, especially\nin data-scarcity scenarios. In addition, experiments show that different\ntraining strategies (e.g., training conditions) may affect the performance of\nAudioLDM on datasets of different scales. To facilitate future studies, we also\nevaluate various text-to-sound generation systems on several frequently used\ndatasets under the same evaluation protocols, which allow fair comparisons and\nbenchmarking of these methods on the common ground.\n","authors":["Yi Yuan","Haohe Liu","Jinhua Liang","Xubo Liu","Mark D.

Existing methods adopt a predictive coding architecture, which\nrequires joint encoding to compress the corresponding disparity as well as\nresidual information. This demands collaboration among cameras and enforces the\nepipolar geometric constraint between different views, which makes it\nchallenging to deploy these methods in distributed camera systems with randomly\noverlapping fields of view. Meanwhile, distributed source coding theory\nindicates that efficient data compression of correlated sources can be achieved\nby independent encoding and joint decoding, which motivates us to design a\nlearning-based distributed multi-view image coding (LDMIC) framework. With\nindependent encoders, LDMIC introduces a simple yet effective joint context\ntransfer module based on the cross-attention mechanism at the decoder to\neffectively capture the global inter-view correlations, which is insensitive to\nthe geometric relationships between images. Experimental results show that\nLDMIC significantly outperforms both traditional and learning-based MIC methods\nwhile enjoying fast encoding speed.

The MISP2022 challenge has two tracks: 1)\naudio-visual speaker diarization (AVSD), aiming to solve ``who spoken when''\nusing both audio and visual data; 2) a novel audio-visual diarization and\nrecognition (AVDR) task that focuses on addressing ``who spoken what when''\nwith audio-visual speaker diarization results. Both tracks focus on the Chinese\nlanguage, and use far-field audio and video in real home-tv scenarios: 2-6\npeople communicating each other with TV noise in the background. This paper\nintroduces the dataset, track settings, and baselines of the MISP2022\nchallenge. Our analyses of experiments and examples indicate the good\nperformance of AVDR baseline system, and the potential difficulties in this\nchallenge due to, e.g., the far-field video quality, the presence of TV noise\nin the background, and the indistinguishable speakers.\n","authors":["Zhe Wang","Shilong Wu","Hang Chen","Mao-Kui He","Jun Du","Chin-Hui Lee","Jingdong Chen","Shinji Watanabe","Sabato Siniscalchi","Odette Scharenborg","Diyuan Liu","Baocai Yin","Jia Pan","Jianqing Gao","Cong Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06326v1.pdf","comment":"5 pages, 4 figures, to be published in ICASSP2023"}]}}
