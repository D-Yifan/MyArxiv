To this end, researchers have proposed several techniques\nto explain model predictions. However, practitioners struggle to use these\nexplainability techniques because they often do not know which one to choose\nand how to interpret the results of the explanations. In this work, we address\nthese challenges by introducing TalkToModel: an interactive dialogue system for\nexplaining machine learning models through conversations. Specifically,\nTalkToModel comprises of three key components: 1) a natural language interface\nfor engaging in conversations, making ML model explainability highly\naccessible, 2) a dialogue engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset,\ninterprets natural language, maps it to appropriate explanations, and generates\ntext responses, and 3) an execution component that constructs the explanations.\nWe carried out extensive quantitative and human subject evaluations of\nTalkToModel. Overall, we found the conversational system understands user\ninputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the\nsystem's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations\nwith humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they\nwould use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability\nin a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel\nwas easier to use for computing explanations.

Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the\ninput, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it\ncomes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\\&L pretrained\nmodels, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its\npronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding\nthat utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP\ntext encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based\nembedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation\nencoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative\nevaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space\nrepresents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed\nphoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm\nthat the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text\nencoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more\nphonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies\nthe correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception\nregarding pronunciation similarity.\n","authors":["Chihaya Matsuhira","Marc A.

When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the\ntext embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix\nembedding.

It is difficult to diagnose and\ncontinues to be underdiagnosed. Because depressed patients constantly share\ntheir symptoms, major life events, and treatments on social media, researchers\nare turning to user-generated digital traces on social media for depression\ndetection. Such methods have distinct advantages in combating depression\nbecause they can facilitate innovative approaches to fight depression and\nalleviate its social and economic burden. However, most existing studies lack\neffective means to incorporate established medical domain knowledge in\ndepression detection or suffer from feature extraction difficulties that impede\ngreater performance. Following the design science research paradigm, we propose\na Deep Knowledge-aware Depression Detection (DKDD) framework to accurately\ndetect social media users at risk of depression and explain the critical\nfactors that contribute to such detection. Extensive empirical studies with\nreal-world data demonstrate that, by incorporating domain knowledge, our method\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work has significant\nimplications for IS research in knowledge-aware machine learning, digital\ntraces utilization, and NLP research in IS.

One line of work generalizes the notion of\nprotected subgroups beyond simple discrete classes by introducing the notion of\na \"rich subgroup\", and seeks to train models that are calibrated or equalize\nerror rates with respect to these richer subgroup classes. Largely\northogonally, local model explanation methods have been developed that given a\nclassifier h and test point x, attribute influence for the prediction h(x) to\nthe individual features of x. This raises a natural question: Do local model\nexplanation methods attribute different feature importance values on average\nacross different protected subgroups, and can we detect these disparities\nefficiently? If the model places high weight on a given feature in a specific\nprotected subgroup, but not on the dataset overall (or vice versa), this could\nbe a potential indicator of bias in the predictive model or the underlying data\ngenerating process, and is at the very least a useful diagnostic that signals\nthe need for a domain expert to delve deeper.

To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose\na semi-supervised sequential variational Bayes (DSVB) framework for transfer\nlearning and state inference in soft robots with missing state labels on\ncertain robot configurations. Considering that soft robots may exhibit distinct\ndynamics under different robot configurations, a feature space transfer\nstrategy is also incorporated to promote the adaptation of latent features\nacross multiple configurations.

To operate in such environments,\nrobots must have robust obstacle avoidance and versatile goal conditioning\nacquired from only a few simple demonstrations. Existing approaches, however,\nfall short of these requirements. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) enables a\nrobot to learn complex manipulation tasks but is often limited to small task\nspaces in the real world due to sample inefficiency and safety concerns. Motion\nplanning (MP) can generate collision-free paths in obstructed environments, but\ncannot solve complex manipulation tasks and requires goal states often\nspecified by a user or object-specific pose estimator. In this work, we propose\na system for efficient skill acquisition that leverages an object-centric\ngenerative model (OCGM) for versatile goal identification to specify a goal for\nMP combined with RL to solve complex manipulation tasks in obstructed\nenvironments. Specifically, OCGM enables one-shot target object identification\nand re-identification in new scenes, allowing MP to guide the robot to the\ntarget object while avoiding obstacles. This is combined with a skill\ntransition network, which bridges the gap between terminal states of MP and\nfeasible start states of a sample-efficient RL policy. The experiments\ndemonstrate that our OCGM-based one-shot goal identification provides\ncompetitive accuracy to other baseline approaches and that our modular\nframework outperforms competitive baselines, including a state-of-the-art RL\nalgorithm, by a significant margin for complex manipulation tasks in obstructed\nenvironments.\n","authors":["Jun Yamada","Jack Collins","Ingmar Posner"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.03365v1.pdf","comment":"8 pages, 5 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03364v1","updated":"2023-03-06T18:49:39Z","published":"2023-03-06T18:49:39Z","title":"Leveraging Scene Embeddings for Gradient-Based Motion Planning in Latent\n  Space","summary":"  Motion planning framed as optimisation in structured latent spaces has\nrecently emerged as competitive with traditional methods in terms of planning\nsuccess while significantly outperforming them in terms of computational speed.\nHowever, the real-world applicability of recent work in this domain remains\nlimited by the need to express obstacle information directly in state-space,\ninvolving simple geometric primitives.

Symbolic systems commonly achieve data efficient generalization by\nexploiting modularity to benefit from local and discrete features of a\nrepresentation. These features allow symbolic programs to be improved one\nmodule at a time and to experience combinatorial growth in the values they can\nsuccessfully process. However, it is difficult to design components that can be\nused to form symbolic abstractions and which are highly-overparametrized like\nneural networks, as the adjustment of parameters makes the semantics of modules\nunstable.

The graphs generation is designed as a sequence of coarse-to-fine\ngenerative models allowing for parallel generation of all sub-structures,\nresulting in a high degree of scalability. Furthermore, we model the output\ndistribution of edges with a more expressive multinomial distribution and\nderive a recursive factorization for this distribution, making it a suitable\nchoice for graph generative models.

Overall, we found the conversational system understands user\ninputs on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the\nsystem's capacity to generalize to new situations. In real-world evaluations\nwith humans, 73% of healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they\nwould use TalkToModel over baseline point-and-click systems for explainability\nin a disease prediction task, and 85% of ML professionals agreed TalkToModel\nwas easier to use for computing explanations.

On the one hand, ID loss learns invariant signals by directly\nminimizing the mean square error between the target samples and positive\nsamples in the representation space. On the other hand, ID loss ensures that\nthe representations are discriminative by an orthonormal constraint forcing the\ndifferent dimensions of representations to be independent of each other.

We exploit classical spatial\ntransformations (i.e. rotation and translation) with the specific parameter as\ntrigger patterns to design a simple yet effective poisoning-based backdoor\nattack. For example, only images rotated to a particular angle can activate the\nembedded backdoor of attacked DNNs.

However, this analysis ignores the dependence of adversarial\nattacks on model parameters. Since adversarial attacks are optimized for\nmodels, they should depend on the parameters. Considering this dependence, we\nanalyze the smoothness of the loss function of adversarial training using the\noptimal attacks for the model parameter in more detail. We reveal that the\nconstraint of adversarial attacks is one cause of the non-smoothness and that\nthe smoothness depends on the types of the constraints. Specifically, the\n$L_\\infty$ constraint can cause non-smoothness more than the $L_2$ constraint.\nMoreover, our analysis implies that if we flatten the loss function with\nrespect to input data, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of adversarial\nloss tends to increase.

Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the\ninput, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it\ncomes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into\nContrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\\&L pretrained\nmodels, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its\npronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding\nthat utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic\nAlphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP\ntext encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based\nembedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation\nencoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative\nevaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space\nrepresents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed\nphoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm\nthat the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text\nencoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more\nphonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies\nthe correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception\nregarding pronunciation similarity.\n","authors":["Chihaya Matsuhira","Marc A.

However, NSI and\nORSI are different in many aspects, such as large coverage, complex background,\nand large differences in target types and scales. Therefore, a new dedicated\nmethod is needed for ORSI-SOD. In addition, existing methods do not pay\nsufficient attention to the boundary of the object, and the completeness of the\nfinal saliency map still needs improvement. To address these issues, we propose\na novel method called Dual Feedback Attention Framework via Boundary-Aware\nAuxiliary and Progressive Semantic Optimization (DFA-BASO). First, Boundary\nProtection Calibration (BPC) module is proposed to reduce the loss of edge\nposition information during forward propagation and suppress noise in low-level\nfeatures. Second, a Dual Feature Feedback Complementary (DFFC) module is\nproposed based on BPC module. It aggregates boundary-semantic dual features and\nprovides effective feedback to coordinate features across different layers.\nFinally, a Strong Semantic Feedback Refinement (SSFR) module is proposed to\nobtain more complete saliency maps. This module further refines feature\nrepresentation and eliminates feature differences through a unique feedback\nmechanism. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that DFA-BASO\noutperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, this paper strongly\ndemonstrates the true contribution of DFA-BASO to ORSI-SOD by in-depth analysis\nof the visualization figure.

One\ncomplication in this learning task is that some users are more likely to\npurchase products or review them, and some products are more likely to be\npurchased or reviewed by the users. This non-uniform pattern degrades the power\nof many existing recommendation algorithms, as they assume that the observed\ndata are sampled uniformly at random among user-product pairs. In addition,\nexisting literature on modeling non-uniformity either assume user interests are\nindependent of the products, or lack theoretical understanding. In this paper,\nwe first model the user-product preferences as a partially observed matrix with\nnon-uniform observation pattern. Next, building on the literature about\nlow-rank matrix estimation, we introduce a new weighted trace-norm penalized\nregression to predict unobserved values of the matrix. We then prove an upper\nbound for the prediction error of our proposed approach. Our upper bound is a\nfunction of a number of parameters that are based on a certain weight matrix\nthat depends on the joint distribution of users and products. Utilizing this\nobservation, we introduce a new optimization problem to select a weight matrix\nthat minimizes the upper bound on the prediction error. The final product is a\nnew estimator, NU-Recommend, that outperforms existing methods in both\nsynthetic and real datasets. Our approach aims at accurate predictions for all\nusers while prioritizing fairness.

There are many methodological decisions that\nneed to be considered in order to obtain scientifically valid results, and each\nof these decisions incur costs.

The problem generalizes the well-studied\nrisk-neutral finite-sum distributed optimization problem and its importance\nstems from the need to handle risk in an uncertain environment. For algorithms\nin the literature, there exists a gap in communication complexities for solving\nrisk-averse and risk-neutral problems. We propose two distributed algorithms,\nnamely the distributed risk averse optimization (DRAO) method and the\ndistributed risk averse optimization with sliding (DRAO-S) method, to close the\ngap. Specifically, the DRAO method achieves the optimal communication\ncomplexity by assuming a certain saddle point subproblem can be easily solved\nin the server node. The DRAO-S method removes the strong assumption by\nintroducing a novel saddle point sliding subroutine which only requires the\nprojection over the ambiguity set $P$.

A natural question to ask is: How much more sample efficiency can\nbe gained by improving the learned dynamics models? Our paper empirically\nanswers this question for the class of model-based value expansion methods in\ncontinuous control problems. Value expansion methods should benefit from\nincreased model accuracy by enabling longer rollout horizons and better value\nfunction approximations. Our empirical study, which leverages oracle dynamics\nmodels to avoid compounding model errors, shows that (1) longer horizons\nincrease sample efficiency, but the gain in improvement decreases with each\nadditional expansion step, and (2) the increased model accuracy only marginally\nincreases the sample efficiency compared to learned models with identical\nhorizons. Therefore, longer horizons and increased model accuracy yield\ndiminishing returns in terms of sample efficiency. These improvements in sample\nefficiency are particularly disappointing when compared to model-free value\nexpansion methods. Even though they introduce no computational overhead, we\nfind their performance to be on-par with model-based value expansion methods.\nTherefore, we conclude that the limitation of model-based value expansion\nmethods is not the model accuracy of the learned models.

Although only the model parameters or\nother model updates are exchanged during the federated training instead of the\nparticipant's data, many attacks have shown that it is still possible to infer\nsensitive information such as membership, property, or outright reconstruction\nof participant data. Although differential privacy is considered an effective\nsolution to protect against privacy attacks, it is also criticized for its\nnegative effect on utility. Another possible defense is to use secure\naggregation which allows the server to only access the aggregated update\ninstead of each individual one, and it is often more appealing because it does\nnot degrade model quality. However, combining only the aggregated updates,\nwhich are generated by a different composition of clients in every round, may\nstill allow the inference of some client-specific information.\n  In this paper, we show that simple linear models can effectively capture\nclient-specific properties only from the aggregated model updates due to the\nlinearity of aggregation. We formulate an optimization problem across different\nrounds in order to infer a tested property of every client from the output of\nthe linear models, for example, whether they have a specific sample in their\ntraining data (membership inference) or whether they misbehave and attempt to\ndegrade the performance of the common model by poisoning attacks. Our\nreconstruction technique is completely passive and undetectable. We demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our approach on several scenarios which shows that secure\naggregation provides very limited privacy guarantees in practice.

By incorporating input distributions and prior knowledge, the FIFK\noperator can address the limitations of using high-dimensional input\ndistributions by semi-supervised assumptions, leading to more precise\napproximations of the integral operator.

With the growing availability of side\ninformation involved in the decision process, modern online matching\nmethodology demands the capability to track preference dynamics for agents\nbased on their contextual information. This motivates us to consider a novel\nContextual Online Matching Bandit prOblem (COMBO), which allows dynamic\npreferences in matching decisions.

Current state-of-the-art deep\nlearning (DL)-based damage detection models, however, often lack superior\nfeature extraction capability in complex and noisy environments, limiting the\ndevelopment of accurate and reliable object distinction.

Existing studies have\nconsidered exclusively noise with persistent root-mean-square amplitude and\noverlooked an opportunity of adjusting the amplitudes to alleviate the adverse\neffects of the noise. This paper presents a new DP perturbation mechanism with\na time-varying noise amplitude to protect the privacy of FL and retain the\ncapability of adjusting the learning performance. Specifically, we propose a\ngeometric series form for the noise amplitude and reveal analytically the\ndependence of the series on the number of global aggregations and the\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP requirement. We derive an online refinement of the\nseries to prevent FL from premature convergence resulting from excessive\nperturbation noise. Another important aspect is an upper bound developed for\nthe loss function of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained by FL running the\nnew DP mechanism. Accordingly, the optimal number of global aggregations is\nobtained, balancing the learning and privacy. Extensive experiments are\nconducted using MLP, supporting vector machine, and convolutional neural\nnetwork models on four public datasets.

There is an accelerating trend of representing a reversible\nsteo-system by monolithic neural networks, which bypass intermediate operations\nin traditional pipelines of reversible steganography. This end-to-end paradigm,\nhowever, suffers from imperfect reversibility. By contrast, the modular\nparadigm that incorporates neural networks into modules of traditional\npipelines can stably guarantee reversibility with mathematical explainability.\nPrediction-error modulation is a well-established reversible steganography\npipeline for digital images. It consists of a predictive analytics module and a\nreversible coding module. Given that reversibility is governed independently by\nthe coding module, we narrow our focus to the incorporation of neural networks\ninto the analytics module, which serves the purpose of predicting pixel\nintensities and a pivotal role in determining capacity and imperceptibility.\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the impacts of different training\nconfigurations upon predictive accuracy of neural networks and provide\npractical insights.

A fundamental pillar of reversible steganography is\npredictive modelling which can be realised via deep neural networks.

In view of this issue, we propose to consider uncertainty in predictive\nmodels based upon a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning, thereby\ncreating an adaptive steganographic system. Most modern deep-learning models\nare regarded as deterministic because they only offer predictions while failing\nto provide uncertainty measurement. Bayesian neural networks bring a\nprobabilistic perspective to deep learning and can be regarded as self-aware\nintelligent machinery; that is, a machine that knows its own limitations. To\nquantify uncertainty, we apply Bayesian statistics to model the predictive\ndistribution and approximate it through Monte Carlo sampling with stochastic\nforward passes.

Our system makes the LLM generate responses\ngrounded in external knowledge, e.g., stored in task-specific databases. It\nalso iteratively revises LLM prompts to improve model responses using feedback\ngenerated by utility functions, e.g., the factuality score of a LLM-generated\nresponse. The effectiveness of LLM-Augmenter is empirically validated on two\ntypes of scenarios, task-oriented dialog and open-domain question answering.\nLLM-Augmenter significantly reduces ChatGPT's hallucinations without\nsacrificing the fluency and informativeness of its responses.

Machine learning (ML) has\nbeen applied in various aspects of human resource management including\nattrition prediction to provide businesses with insights on proactive measures\non how to prevent talented employees from quitting.

Such\ndisentangled representations make easier to interpret the significant latent\nfactors of variation in the data, as well as to generate new data with\ndesirable features. Methods for disentangling representations often rely on an\nadversarial scheme, in which representations are tuned to avoid discriminators\nfrom being able to reconstruct information about the data properties (labels).\nUnfortunately adversarial training is generally difficult to implement in\npractice. Here we propose a simple, effective way of disentangling\nrepresentations without any need to train adversarial discriminators, and apply\nour approach to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM), one of the simplest\nrepresentation-based generative models. Our approach relies on the introduction\nof adequate constraints on the weights during training, which allows us to\nconcentrate information about labels on a small subset of latent variables. The\neffectiveness of the approach is illustrated with four examples: the CelebA\ndataset of facial images, the two-dimensional Ising model, the MNIST dataset of\nhandwritten digits, and the taxonomy of protein families. In addition, we show\nhow our framework allows for analytically computing the cost, in terms of\nlog-likelihood of the data, associated to the disentanglement of their\nrepresentations.\n","authors":["Jorge Fernandez-de-Cossio-Diaz","Simona Cocco","Remi Monasson"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11600v4.pdf","comment":"Minor corrections.

In object-oriented environments, predicates are a particularly useful\nform of state abstraction because of their compatibility with symbolic planners\nand their capacity for relational generalization. However, to plan with\npredicates, the agent must be able to interpret them in continuous environment\nstates (i.e., ground the symbols). Manually programming predicate\ninterpretations can be difficult, so we would instead like to learn them from\ndata. We propose an embodied active learning paradigm where the agent learns\npredicate interpretations through online interaction with an expert. For\nexample, after taking actions in a block stacking environment, the agent may\nask the expert: \"Is On(block1, block2) true?\" From this experience, the agent\nlearns to plan: it learns neural predicate interpretations, symbolic planning\noperators, and neural samplers that can be used for bilevel planning. During\nexploration, the agent plans to learn: it uses its current models to select\nactions towards generating informative expert queries. We learn predicate\ninterpretations as ensembles of neural networks and use their entropy to\nmeasure the informativeness of potential queries. We evaluate this approach in\nthree robotic environments and find that it consistently outperforms six\nbaselines while exhibiting sample efficiency in two key metrics: number of\nenvironment interactions, and number of queries to the expert.

Recent work has developed methods to automate formal\nverification using proof assistants, such as Coq and Isabelle/HOL, e.g., by\ntraining a model to predict one proof step at a time, and using that model to\nsearch through the space of possible proofs. This paper introduces a new method\nto automate formal verification: We use large language models, trained on\nnatural language text and code and fine-tuned on proofs, to generate whole\nproofs for theorems at once, rather than one step at a time. We combine this\nproof generation model with a fine-tuned repair model to repair generated\nproofs, further increasing proving power. As its main contributions, this paper\ndemonstrates for the first time that: (1) Whole-proof generation using\ntransformers is possible and is as effective as search-based techniques without\nrequiring costly search. (2) Giving the learned model additional context, such\nas a prior failed proof attempt and the ensuing error message, results in proof\nrepair and further improves automated proof generation.

DeepGD not only selects test inputs with high uncertainty scores to\ntrigger as many mispredicted inputs as possible but also maximizes the\nprobability of revealing distinct faults in the DNN model by selecting diverse\nmispredicted inputs.\n  The experimental results conducted on four widely used datasets and five DNN\nmodels show that in terms of fault-revealing ability: (1) White-box,\ncoverage-based approaches fare poorly, (2) DeepGD outperforms existing\nblack-box test selection approaches in terms of fault detection, and (3) DeepGD\nalso leads to better guidance for DNN model retraining when using selected\ninputs to augment the training set.\n","authors":["Zohreh Aghababaeyan","Manel Abdellatif","Mahboubeh Dadkhah","Lionel Briand"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.04878v1.pdf","comment":null}],"Multi Media":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04626v1","updated":"2023-03-08T14:45:51Z","published":"2023-03-08T14:45:51Z","title":"Multi-MEC Cooperation Based VR Video Transmission and Cache using\n  K-Shortest Paths Optimization","summary":"  In recent network architectures, multi-MEC cooperative caching has been\nintroduced to reduce the transmission latency of VR videos, in which MEC\nservers' computing and caching capability are utilized to optimize the\ntransmission process.

Despite its benefit, we reveal that\ncurrent mainstream works with SR enhancement have not achieved the desired\nrate-distortion trade-off between bitrate saving and quality restoration, due\nto: (1) overemphasizing the enhancement on the decoder side while omitting the\nco-design of encoder, (2) limited generative capacity to recover high-fidelity\nperceptual details, and (3) optimizing the compression-and-restoration pipeline\nfrom the resolution perspective solely, without considering color bit-depth.\nAiming at overcoming these limitations, we are the first to conduct an\nencoder-decoder (i.e., codec) synergy by leveraging the inherent\nvisual-generative property of diffusion models.

The main reason is that\nconventional Transformer decoding algorithms may not be the best choice for\ncode generation.

The Transformer can\ntherefore make more informed decisions and generate tokens that will eventually\nlead to higher-quality programs.

Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive\nperformance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to\nmodels that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA\nmodel). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions).

In this work, we propose a novel\napproach for open world instance segmentation called bottom-Up and top-Down\nOpen-world Segmentation (UDOS) that combines classical bottom-up segmentation\nalgorithms within a top-down learning framework. UDOS first predicts parts of\nobjects using a top-down network trained with weak supervision from bottom-up\nsegmentations. The bottom-up segmentations are class-agnostic and do not\noverfit to specific taxonomies. The part-masks are then fed into affinity-based\ngrouping and refinement modules to predict robust instance-level segmentations.\nUDOS enjoys both the speed and efficiency from the top-down architectures and\nthe generalization ability to unseen categories from bottom-up supervision. We\nvalidate the strengths of UDOS on multiple cross-category as well as\ncross-dataset transfer tasks from 5 challenging datasets including MS-COCO,\nLVIS, ADE20k, UVO and OpenImages, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art across the board.

However, in many settings, giving\none type of feedback (e.g. a demonstration) may be much more difficult than a\ndifferent type of feedback (e.g. answering a comparison query). Thus, we expect\nto see more or less noise depending on the type of human feedback. In this\nwork, we advocate that grounding the rationality coefficient in real data for\neach feedback type, rather than assuming a default value, has a significant\npositive effect on reward learning. We test this in both simulated experiments\nand in a user study with real human feedback. We find that overestimating human\nrationality can have dire effects on reward learning accuracy and regret. We\nalso find that fitting the rationality coefficient to human data enables better\nreward learning, even when the human deviates significantly from the\nnoisy-rational choice model due to systematic biases. Further, we find that the\nrationality level affects the informativeness of each feedback type:\nsurprisingly, demonstrations are not always the most informative -- when the\nhuman acts very suboptimally, comparisons actually become more informative,\neven when the rationality level is the same for both.

We show that the image representations from vision\nmodels can be transferred as continuous prompts to frozen LMs by training only\na single linear projection. Using these to prompt the LM achieves competitive\nperformance on captioning and visual question answering tasks compared to\nmodels that tune both the image encoder and text decoder (such as the MAGMA\nmodel). We compare three image encoders with increasing amounts of linguistic\nsupervision seen during pretraining: BEIT (no linguistic information),\nNF-ResNET (lexical category information), and CLIP (full natural language\ndescriptions). We find that all three encoders perform equally well at\ntransferring visual property information to the language model (e.g., whether\nan animal is large or small), but that image encoders pretrained with\nlinguistic supervision more saliently encode category information (e.g.,\ndistinguishing hippo vs. elephant) and thus perform significantly better on\nbenchmark language-and-vision tasks. Our results indicate that LMs encode\nconceptual information structurally similarly to vision-based models, even\nthose that are solely trained on images.

Quite surprisingly training the\nneural network via (stochastic) gradient descent leads to models that\ngeneralize very well, while classical statistics would suggest overfitting. In\norder to gain understanding of this implicit bias phenomenon we study the\nspecial case of sparse recovery (compressed sensing) which is of interest on\nits own. More precisely, in order to reconstruct a vector from underdetermined\nlinear measurements, we introduce a corresponding overparameterized square loss\nfunctional, where the vector to be reconstructed is deeply factorized into\nseveral vectors. We show that, if there exists an exact solution, vanilla\ngradient flow for the overparameterized loss functional converges to a good\napproximation of the solution of minimal $\\ell_1$-norm. The latter is\nwell-known to promote sparse solutions. As a by-product, our results\nsignificantly improve the sample complexity for compressed sensing via gradient\nflow/descent on overparameterized models derived in previous works. The theory\naccurately predicts the recovery rate in numerical experiments. Our proof\nrelies on analyzing a certain Bregman divergence of the flow.

In many\ncases the rough location may be known and a UAV can be deployed to explore a\ngiven, confined area to precisely localize the missing people. Due to time and\nbattery constraints it is often critical that localization is performed as\nefficiently as possible. In this work we approach this type of problem by\nabstracting it as an aerial view goal localization task in a framework that\nemulates a SAR-like setup without requiring access to actual UAVs. In this\nframework, an agent operates on top of an aerial image (proxy for a search\narea) and is tasked with localizing a goal that is described in terms of visual\ncues. To further mimic the situation on an actual UAV, the agent is not able to\nobserve the search area in its entirety, not even at low resolution, and thus\nit has to operate solely based on partial glimpses when navigating towards the\ngoal. To tackle this task, we propose AiRLoc, a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based model that decouples exploration (searching for distant goals) and\nexploitation (localizing nearby goals).

A fingerprinting technique\nintroduced at ICLR '21, Dataset Inference (DI), has been shown to offer better\nrobustness and efficiency than prior methods. The authors of DI provided a\ncorrectness proof for linear (suspect) models. However, in the same setting, we\nprove that DI suffers from high false positives (FPs) -- it can incorrectly\nidentify an independent model trained with non-overlapping data from the same\ndistribution as stolen. We further prove that DI also triggers FPs in\nrealistic, non-linear suspect models. We then confirm empirically that DI leads\nto FPs, with high confidence. Second, we show that DI also suffers from false\nnegatives (FNs) -- an adversary can fool DI by regularising a stolen model's\ndecision boundaries using adversarial training, thereby leading to an FN.

The memory and computational requirements arising\nfrom propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every\nconnected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations,\ncontribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a\nsolution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication\nbetween RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with\nbackpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as\nwell.

Most previous studies of\ndischarge summary generation using the sequence-to-sequence architecture focus\non only inpatient notes for input. However, electric health records (EHR) also\nhave rich structured metadata (e.g., hospital, physician, disease, length of\nstay, etc.) that might be useful. This paper investigates the effectiveness of\nmedical meta-information for summarization tasks. We obtain four types of\nmeta-information from the EHR systems and encode each meta-information into a\nsequence-to-sequence model. Using Japanese EHRs, meta-information encoded\nmodels increased ROUGE-1 by up to 4.45 points and BERTScore by 3.77 points over\nthe vanilla Longformer. Also, we found that the encoded meta-information\nimproves the precisions of its related terms in the outputs.

In hard distillation, a\nteacher model transcribes large amounts of unlabelled speech to train a student\nmodel. Soft distillation is another popular KD method that distills the output\nlogits of the teacher model. Due to the nature of RNN-T alignments, applying\nsoft distillation between RNN-T architectures having different posterior\ndistributions is challenging. In addition, bad teachers having high\nword-error-rate (WER) reduce the efficacy of KD. We investigate how to\neffectively distill knowledge from variable quality ASR teachers, which has not\nbeen studied before to the best of our knowledge. We show that a sequence-level\nKD, full-sum distillation, outperforms other distillation methods for RNN-T\nmodels, especially for bad teachers.

Although preserving legibility is a necessary\ncondition for text perturbation, little work has been done to systematically\ncharacterize it; instead, legibility is typically loosely enforced via\nintuitions around the nature and extent of perturbations. Particularly, it is\nunclear to what extent can inputs be perturbed while preserving legibility, or\nhow to quantify the legibility of a perturbed string. In this work, we address\nthis gap by learning models that predict the legibility of a perturbed string,\nand rank candidate perturbations based on their legibility. To do so, we\ncollect and release LEGIT, a human-annotated dataset comprising the legibility\nof visually perturbed text. Using this dataset, we build both text- and\nvision-based models which achieve up to $0.91$ F1 score in predicting whether\nan input is legible, and an accuracy of $0.86$ in predicting which of two given\nperturbations is more legible. Additionally, we discover that legible\nperturbations from the LEGIT dataset are more effective at lowering the\nperformance of NLP models than best-known attack strategies, suggesting that\ncurrent models may be vulnerable to a broad range of perturbations beyond what\nis captured by existing visual attacks.

Using two NDP variants and an exact solver as\nbenchmark, we show that our proposed framework can provide solutions within 5%\ngap of the global optimum results given less than 1% of the time required for\nfinding the optimal results. Moreover, we observe many interesting future\ndirections, thus we propose a brief research agenda for this topic. The key\nobservation inspiring influential future research was that fitness function\nevaluation time using the inferences made by the GNN model for the genetic\nalgorithm was in the order of milliseconds, which points to an opportunity and\na need for novel heuristics that 1) can cope well with noisy fitness function\nvalues provided by neural networks, and 2) can use the significantly higher\ncomputation time provided to them to explore the search space effectively\n(rather than efficiently).

We hypothesise that for the sports betting problem, model calibration\nis more important than accuracy. To test this hypothesis, we train models on\nNBA data over several seasons and run betting experiments on a single season,\nusing published odds. Evaluating various betting systems, we show that\noptimising the forecasting model for calibration leads to greater returns than\noptimising for accuracy, on average (return on investment of $110.42\\%$ versus\n$2.98\\%$) and in the best case ($902.01\\%$ versus $222.84\\%$).

In this paper, we\nfirst identify that this negligence leads to impeded information flow and the\naccompanying degradation problem in previous residual SNNs. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel SNN-oriented residual architecture termed MS-ResNet,\nwhich establishes membrane-based shortcut pathways, and further prove that the\ngradient norm equality can be achieved in MS-ResNet by introducing block\ndynamical isometry theory, which ensures the network can be well-behaved in a\ndepth-insensitive way. Thus we are able to significantly extend the depth of\ndirectly trained SNNs, e.g., up to 482 layers on CIFAR-10 and 104 layers on\nImageNet, without observing any slight degradation problem. To validate the\neffectiveness of MS-ResNet, experiments on both frame-based and neuromorphic\ndatasets are conducted. MS-ResNet104 achieves a superior result of 76.02%\naccuracy on ImageNet, which is the highest to our best knowledge in the domain\nof directly trained SNNs.

In addition, we introduce an inverse query algorithm to freely\nmanipulate any specified 3D object shape in the learned scene representation.\nNotably, our manipulation algorithm can explicitly tackle key issues such as\nobject collisions and visual occlusions. Our method, called DM-NeRF, is among\nthe first to simultaneously reconstruct, decompose, manipulate and render\ncomplex 3D scenes in a single pipeline. Extensive experiments on three datasets\nclearly show that our method can accurately decompose all 3D objects from 2D\nviews, allowing any interested object to be freely manipulated in 3D space such\nas translation, rotation, size adjustment, and deformation.\n","authors":["Bing Wang","Lu Chen","Bo Yang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07227v2.pdf","comment":"ICLR 2023.

For multi-agent BO problems,\nthe computational cost of ES is exponential in the number of agents. To address\nthis challenge, we propose the Gaussian Max-value Entropy Search, a multi-agent\nBO algorithm with favorable sample and computational efficiency. The key to our\nidea is to use a normal distribution to approximate the function maximum and\ncalculate its mutual information accordingly. The resulting approximation\nallows queries to be cast as the solution of a closed-form optimization problem\nwhich, in turn, can be solved via a modified gradient ascent algorithm and\nscaled to a large number of agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nGaussian max-value Entropy Search through numerical experiments on standard\ntest functions and real-robot experiments on the source-seeking problem.\nResults show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the multi-agent BO\nbaselines in the numerical experiments and can stably seek the source with a\nlimited number of noisy observations on real robots.\n","authors":["Haitong Ma","Tianpeng Zhang","Yixuan Wu","Flavio P.

Over 300 wheat plant images\nwere collected using a multispectral 3D scanner, and the labelled UW-MRDC 3D\nwheat dataset was created. The data was used to develop novel and efficient 3D\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) models for FHB detection, which achieved\n100% accuracy. The influence of the multispectral information on performance\nwas evaluated, and our results showed the dominance of the RGB channels over\nboth the NIR and the NIR plus RGB channels combined. Furthermore, novel and\nefficient 3D CNNs were created to estimate the total number of spikelets and\nthe total number of infected spikelets on a wheat head, and our best models\nachieved mean absolute errors (MAE) of 1.13 and 1.56, respectively. Moreover,\n3D CNN models for FHB severity estimation were created, and our best model\nachieved 8.6 MAE. A linear regression analysis between the visual FHB severity\nassessment and the FHB severity predicted by our 3D CNN was performed, and the\nresults showed a significant correlation between the two variables with a\n0.0001 P-value and 0.94 R-squared.\n","authors":["Oumaima Hamila","Christopher J.

Recently, pre-training has\nachieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible\nfor CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable\nembeddings, which can be easily transferred. In this work, we revisit CIL with\nPTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model updating\nand generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal that frozen\nPTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL. Surprisingly, a\nsimple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the classifiers of PTM to\nprototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without training on the\ndownstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between pre-trained and\ndownstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with adaptivity via model\nadapting.

ADAM is a general framework\nthat can be orthogonally combined with any parameter-efficient tuning method,\nwhich holds the advantages of PTM's generalizability and adapted model's\nadaptivity. 3) Additionally, we find previous benchmarks are unsuitable in the\nera of PTM due to data overlapping and propose four new benchmarks for\nassessment, namely ImageNet-A, ObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB.

Over the past two decades,\nthere has been a fundamental shift in the trend of MI-EEG classifiers,\nresulting in a gradual increase in their performance. The emergence of\nTensor-CSPNet, the first geometric deep learning (GDL) framework in BCI\nresearch, is attributed to the imperative of characterizing the non-Euclidean\nnature of signals. Fundamentally, Tensor-CSPNet is a deep learning-based\nclassifier that capitalizes on the second-order statistics of EEGs.

However, the main shortcoming of this prior work is that it does\nnot model a mechanism's uncertainty over values for not yet elicited bundles.\nIn this paper, we address this shortcoming by presenting a Bayesian\noptimization-based combinatorial assignment (BOCA) mechanism. Our key technical\ncontribution is to integrate a method for capturing model uncertainty into an\niterative combinatorial auction mechanism.

In this paper, we\npropose to adapt the model architecture after deployment in the target\nenvironment, where the model quality can be precisely measured and private edge\ndata can be retained. To achieve efficient and effective edge model generation,\nwe introduce a pretraining-assisted on-cloud model elastification method and an\nedge-friendly on-device architecture search method. Model elastification\ngenerates a high-quality search space of model architectures with the guidance\nof a developer-specified oracle model. Each subnet in the space is a valid\nmodel with different environment affinity, and each device efficiently finds\nand maintains the most suitable subnet based on a series of edge-tailored\noptimizations. Extensive experiments on various edge devices demonstrate that\nour approach is able to achieve significantly better accuracy-latency tradeoffs\n(e.g. 46.74\\% higher on average accuracy with a 60\\% latency budget) than\nstrong baselines with minimal overhead (13 GPU hours in the cloud and 2 minutes\non the edge server).\n","authors":["Hao Wen","Yuanchun Li","Zunshuai Zhang","Shiqi Jiang","Xiaozhou Ye","Ye Ouyang","Ya-Qin Zhang","Yunxin Liu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.07129v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07127v1","updated":"2023-03-13T13:58:03Z","published":"2023-03-13T13:58:03Z","title":"Improving physics-informed neural networks with meta-learned\n  optimization","summary":"  We show that the error achievable using physics-informed neural networks for\nsolving systems of differential equations can be substantially reduced when\nthese networks are trained using meta-learned optimization methods rather than\nto using fixed, hand-crafted optimizers as traditionally done.

Considered together, the CNN lack of adversarial\nrobustness and the CNN lack of invariance mean that the classification of\nsymmetric adversarial samples can differ from their incorrect classification.\nCould symmetric adversarial samples revert to their correct classification?\nThis paper answers this question by designing a symmetry defense that inverts\nor horizontally flips adversarial samples before classification against\nadversaries unaware of the defense.

In\nthis work, we present a unifying view of existing MI bounds from the\nperspective of importance sampling, and propose three novel bounds based on\nthis approach. Since accurate estimation of MI without density information\nrequires a sample size exponential in the true MI, we assume either a single\nmarginal or the full joint density information is known.

However, even the most accurate NNs can be biased\ntoward a specific output classification due to the inherent bias in the\navailable training datasets, which may propagate to the real-world\nimplementations. This paper deals with the robustness bias, i.e., the bias\nexhibited by the trained NN by having a significantly large robustness to noise\nfor a certain output class, as compared to the remaining output classes. The\nbias is shown to result from imbalanced datasets, i.e., the datasets where all\noutput classes are not equally represented. Towards this, we propose the\nUnbiasedNets framework, which leverages K-means clustering and the NN's noise\ntolerance to diversify the given training dataset, even from relatively smaller\ndatasets. This generates balanced datasets and reduces the bias within the\ndatasets themselves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework\ncatering to the robustness bias problem in NNs. We use real-world datasets to\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the UnbiasedNets for data diversification, in case\nof both binary and multi-label classifiers. The results are compared to\nwell-known tools aimed at generating balanced datasets, and illustrate how\nexisting works have limited success while addressing the robustness bias.

Many existing tools\nrely on uniform convergence (UC), a property that, when it holds, guarantees\nthat the test loss will be close to the training loss, uniformly over a class\nof candidate models. Nagarajan and Kolter (2019) show that in certain simple\nlinear and neural-network settings, any uniform convergence bound will be\nvacuous, leaving open the question of how to prove generalization in settings\nwhere UC fails. Our main contribution is proving novel generalization bounds in\ntwo such settings, one linear, and one non-linear. We study the linear\nclassification setting of Nagarajan and Kolter, and a quadratic ground truth\nfunction learned via a two-layer neural network in the non-linear regime. We\nprove a new type of margin bound showing that above a certain signal-to-noise\nthreshold, any near-max-margin classifier will achieve almost no test loss in\nthese two settings. Our results show that near-max-margin is important: while\nany model that achieves at least a $(1 - \\epsilon)$-fraction of the max-margin\ngeneralizes well, a classifier achieving half of the max-margin may fail\nterribly. Building on the impossibility results of Nagarajan and Kolter, under\nslightly stronger assumptions, we show that one-sided UC bounds and classical\nmargin bounds will fail on near-max-margin classifiers. Our analysis provides\ninsight on why memorization can coexist with generalization: we show that in\nthis challenging regime where generalization occurs but UC fails,\nnear-max-margin classifiers simultaneously contain some generalizable\ncomponents and some overfitting components that memorize the data.

This\npaper studies the problem of distributed multi-agent learning without resorting\nto centralized components or explicit communication. It examines the use of\ndistribution matching to facilitate the coordination of independent agents. In\nthe proposed scheme, each agent independently minimizes the distribution\nmismatch to the corresponding component of a target visitation distribution.\nThe theoretical analysis shows that under certain conditions, each agent\nminimizing its individual distribution mismatch allows the convergence to the\njoint policy that generated the target distribution. Further, if the target\ndistribution is from a joint policy that optimizes a cooperative task, the\noptimal policy for a combination of this task reward and the distribution\nmatching reward is the same joint policy.

The proposed CVIB framework is composed of an original\nnetwork and a self-pruned network, and these two networks are optimized\nsimultaneously via contrastive learning. Concretely, we employ the Variational\nInformation Bottleneck (VIB) principle to learn an informative and compressed\nnetwork (self-pruned network) from the original network, which discards the\nsuperfluous patterns or spurious correlations between input features and\nprediction labels. Then, self-pruning contrastive learning is devised to pull\ntogether semantically similar positive pairs and push away dissimilar pairs,\nwhere the representations of the anchor learned by the original and self-pruned\nnetworks respectively are regarded as a positive pair while the representations\nof two different sentences within a mini-batch are treated as a negative pair.\nTo verify the effectiveness of our CVIB method, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on five benchmark ABSA datasets and the experimental results show\nthat our approach achieves better performance than the strong competitors in\nterms of overall prediction performance, robustness, and generalization.\n","authors":["Mingshan Chang","Min Yang","Qingshan Jiang","Ruifeng Xu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02846v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06675v1","updated":"2023-03-12T14:31:44Z","published":"2023-03-12T14:31:44Z","title":"LUKE-Graph: A Transformer-based Approach with Gated Relational Graph\n  Attention for Cloze-style Reading Comprehension","summary":"  Incorporating prior knowledge can improve existing pre-training models in\ncloze-style machine reading and has become a new trend in recent studies.\nNotably, most of the existing models have integrated external knowledge graphs\n(KG) and transformer-based models, such as BERT into a unified data structure.\nHowever, selecting the most relevant ambiguous entities in KG and extracting\nthe best subgraph remains a challenge.

Existing studies on provider fairness usually focused on\ndesigning proportion fairness (PF) metrics that first consider systematic\nfairness. However, sociological researches show that to make the market more\nstable, max-min fairness (MMF) is a better metric. The main reason is that MMF\naims to improve the utility of the worst ones preferentially, guiding the\nsystem to support the providers in weak market positions. When applying MMF to\nrecommender systems, how to balance user preferences and provider fairness in\nan online recommendation scenario is still a challenging problem. In this\npaper, we proposed an online re-ranking model named Provider Max-min Fairness\nRe-ranking (P-MMF) to tackle the problem. Specifically, P-MMF formulates\nprovider fair recommendation as a resource allocation problem, where the\nexposure slots are considered the resources to be allocated to providers and\nthe max-min fairness is used as the regularizer during the process.

However, this framework still requires a\ncentralized global model to consolidate individual models into one, and the\ndevices train synchronously, which both can be potential bottlenecks for using\nfederated learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method of asynchronous\ndecentralized federated lifelong learning (ADFLL) method that inherits the\nmerits of federated learning and can train on multiple tasks simultaneously\nwithout the need for a central node or synchronous training. Thus, overcoming\nthe potential drawbacks of conventional federated learning.

Our framework allows agents to achieve the best performance with a\nmean distance error of 7.81, better than the conventional all-knowing agent's\nmean distance error of 11.78, and significantly (p=0.01) better than a\nconventional lifelong learning agent with a distance error of 15.17 after eight\nrounds of training.

While significant research progress has been made toward the development\nof dark pattern taxonomies, developers and users currently lack guidance to\nhelp recognize, avoid, and navigate these often subtle design motifs.

To this\nend, this paper proposes a novel sequential recommender system, AutoMLP, aiming\nfor better modeling users' long/short-term interests from their historical\ninteractions. In addition, we design an automated and adaptive search algorithm\nfor preferable short-term interest length via end-to-end optimization. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that AutoMLP has competitive performance against\nstate-of-the-art methods, while maintaining linear computational complexity.\n","authors":["Muyang Li","Zijian Zhang","Xiangyu Zhao","Wanyu Wang","Minghao Zhao","Runze Wu","Ruocheng Guo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06337v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted by WWW'23"}],"Multi Media":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02353v2","updated":"2023-03-11T19:53:30Z","published":"2023-03-04T08:33:46Z","title":"Self-Asymmetric Invertible Network for Compression-Aware Image Rescaling","summary":"  High-resolution (HR) images are usually downscaled to low-resolution (LR)\nones for better display and afterward upscaled back to the original size to\nrecover details. Recent work in image rescaling formulates downscaling and\nupscaling as a unified task and learns a bijective mapping between HR and LR\nvia invertible networks. However, in real-world applications (e.g., social\nmedia), most images are compressed for transmission. Lossy compression will\nlead to irreversible information loss on LR images, hence damaging the inverse\nupscaling procedure and degrading the reconstruction accuracy. In this paper,\nwe propose the Self-Asymmetric Invertible Network (SAIN) for compression-aware\nimage rescaling. To tackle the distribution shift, we first develop an\nend-to-end asymmetric framework with two separate bijective mappings for\nhigh-quality and compressed LR images, respectively. Then, based on empirical\nanalysis of this framework, we model the distribution of the lost information\n(including downscaling and compression) using isotropic Gaussian mixtures and\npropose the Enhanced Invertible Block to derive high-quality/compressed LR\nimages in one forward pass. Besides, we design a set of losses to regularize\nthe learned LR images and enhance the invertibility. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the consistent improvements of SAIN across various image rescaling\ndatasets in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation under\nstandard image compression formats (i.e., JPEG and WebP).\n","authors":["Jinhai Yang","Mengxi Guo","Shijie Zhao","Junlin Li","Li Zhang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02353v2.pdf","comment":"Accepted by AAAI 2023.

However, recent studies show\nthat the imbalanced optimization of uni-modal encoders in a joint-learning\nmodel is a bottleneck to enhancing the model's performance. We further find\nthat the up-to-date imbalance-mitigating methods fail on some audio-visual\nfine-grained tasks, which have a higher demand for distinguishable feature\ndistribution. Fueled by the success of cosine loss that builds hyperspherical\nfeature spaces and achieves lower intra-class angular variability, this paper\nproposes Multi-Modal Cosine loss, MMCosine. It performs a modality-wise $L_2$\nnormalization to features and weights towards balanced and better multi-modal\nfine-grained learning. We demonstrate that our method can alleviate the\nimbalanced optimization from the perspective of weight norm and fully exploit\nthe discriminability of the cosine metric. Extensive experiments prove the\neffectiveness of our method and the versatility with advanced multi-modal\nfusion strategies and up-to-date imbalance-mitigating methods.\n","authors":["Ruize Xu","Ruoxuan Feng","Shi-Xiong Zhang","Di Hu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05338v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04216v4","updated":"2023-03-11T14:49:56Z","published":"2022-10-09T10:10:13Z","title":"AMPose: Alternatively Mixed Global-Local Attention Model for 3D Human\n  Pose Estimation","summary":"  The graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been applied to model the\nphysically connected and non-local relations among human joints for 3D human\npose estimation (HPE). In addition, the purely Transformer-based models\nrecently show promising results in video-based 3D HPE. However, the\nsingle-frame method still needs to model the physically connected relations\namong joints because the feature representations transformed only by global\nrelations via the Transformer neglect information on the human skeleton. To\ndeal with this problem, we propose a novel method in which the Transformer\nencoder and GCN blocks are alternately stacked, namely AMPose, to combine the\nglobal and physically connected relations among joints towards HPE. In the\nAMPose, the Transformer encoder is applied to connect each joint with all the\nother joints, while GCNs are applied to capture information on physically\nconnected relations. The effectiveness of our proposed method is evaluated on\nthe Human3.6M dataset. Our model also shows better generalization ability by\ntesting on the MPI-INF-3DHP dataset.

Existing methods adopt a predictive coding architecture, which\nrequires joint encoding to compress the corresponding disparity as well as\nresidual information. This demands collaboration among cameras and enforces the\nepipolar geometric constraint between different views, which makes it\nchallenging to deploy these methods in distributed camera systems with randomly\noverlapping fields of view. Meanwhile, distributed source coding theory\nindicates that efficient data compression of correlated sources can be achieved\nby independent encoding and joint decoding, which motivates us to design a\nlearning-based distributed multi-view image coding (LDMIC) framework. With\nindependent encoders, LDMIC introduces a simple yet effective joint context\ntransfer module based on the cross-attention mechanism at the decoder to\neffectively capture the global inter-view correlations, which is insensitive to\nthe geometric relationships between images.
